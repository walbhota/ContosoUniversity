# School(University) Management System

This project aims to develop a paginated view university management system using C#, ASP.Net Core, and SQLite. The system is designed to facilitate efficient management of various academic and administrative tasks within a school or university setting.

## Features

The School(University) Management System will include the following key features:

- **Student Management**: Allows administrators to manage student records, including enrollment, personal information, academic performance, and attendance.
- **Faculty Management**: Provides a platform for managing faculty information, such as hiring, assignment of courses, scheduling, and performance evaluation.
- **Course Management**: Enables the creation, modification, and deletion of courses offered by the university. It also allows for assigning faculty members to specific courses and managing course-related information.
- **Classroom Management**: Helps in managing classrooms and scheduling classes, including assigning classrooms to specific courses, managing class timings, and generating timetables.
- **Enrollment Management**: Facilitates the process of student enrollment, including course selection, fee payment, and generating enrollment reports.
- **Attendance Management**: Allows for tracking and managing student attendance records, generating attendance reports, and identifying patterns of absenteeism.
- **Grade Management**: Provides a platform for managing student grades, calculating GPA, generating grade reports, and monitoring academic progress.
- **Library Management**: Enables the management of the university library, including book cataloging, issuing and returning books, tracking overdue fines, and generating library reports.
- **Financial Management**: Helps in managing financial aspects, such as fee collection, expense tracking, generating financial reports, and budget planning.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Implements secure user authentication and role-based authorization to ensure data privacy and access control.

## Models

The following models are used in the School(University) Management System:

- AssignedCourseData
- EnrollmentDateGroup
- InstructorIndexData
- Course
- Department
- Enrollment
- Instructor
- OfficeAssignment
- Students

## Concurrency Conflict Detection

The system incorporates a concurrency conflict detection mechanism to handle situations where multiple users attempt to modify the same data simultaneously. This feature ensures data integrity and prevents conflicts by detecting and resolving concurrency issues.

## Technologies Used

The School(University) Management System is developed using the following technologies:

- C#: A versatile and widely-used programming language for building robust and scalable applications.
- ASP.Net Core: A cross-platform framework for building web applications using C# and .NET.
- SQLite: A lightweight and efficient database management system that offers easy integration with .NET applications.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured approach with separate modules or layers for different functionalities, ensuring modularity and maintainability. The codebase is organized into logical components such as models, controllers, views, and data access layers. The SQLite database is utilized to store and retrieve data efficiently.

## Conclusion

The School(University) Management System, developed using C#, ASP.Net Core, and SQLite, aims to streamline administrative processes, enhance communication between stakeholders, and improve overall efficiency within educational institutions. By providing a comprehensive and user-friendly interface, the system empowers administrators, faculty, and students to manage their academic and administrative tasks effectively.
